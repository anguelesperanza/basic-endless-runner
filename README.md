#Hello

This is an endless runner I made in the ODIN language.

The orignal repo can be found on codeberg as well: https://codeberg.org/anguelesperanza/basic-endless-runner

This is a basic endless runner so nothing complicated. Moreso to prove to myself I could make a game more than anything.
